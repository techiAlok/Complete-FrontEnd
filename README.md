Frontend Learning Assignments & Projects

This repository is a comprehensive collection of all code written during my self-paced learning journey in core frontend technologies.
It serves as a detailed portfolio demonstrating my progression and mastery of fundamental concepts.

HTML: Semantic markup, form design, and accessibility fundamentals.
CSS: Layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid), responsive design (media queries), and basic animation/transitions.
JavaScript (ES6+): DOM manipulation, event handling, data structures, and core programming logic.

Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders reflecting the core curriculum structure:

1-HTML: Basic to advanced HTML assignments.
2-CSS: Styling exercises, including layout, component design, and responsiveness.
3-JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript logic assignments, including DOM manipulation, event listeners, and small scripts.
